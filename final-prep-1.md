## Cooperation Plan

What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- Branden Ge - JavaScript logic, testing, and backend
- Daniel Frey: JavaScript logic either front or backend
- Stephanie Hill: CSS/Visual
- Timothee Odushina: backend, next
- Keelen Fisher: Front end, JavaScript logic
- Brandon Pitts - Backend, api's

How can we best utilize these strengths in the execution of our project?

First we want to try to give everyone a chance to work on their preferred area of interest, which does not necessarily have to be their strongest. But our team members that may be stronger in a particular area can advise wherever their expertise is needed.

In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

- Branden Ge: React, Redux, Express, MongoDB, APIs
- Daniel Frey: Documentation
- Stephanie Hill: Root Cause Resolution
- Timothee Odushina: React, Redux, CSS
- Keelen Fisher: React, Redux, MUI, APIs, and CRUD
- Brandon Pitts: Craft

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day to day work?

- Hold daily stand up's
- Are there any merges outstanding
- Git pull origin main to make sure we’re in the same place
- Plan the timeline based on the structure of the project
- Check in before or after lunch to make sure the team is aligned
- Check if there are any merges
- Merge branches often so we are coordinated and nothing changes too drastically.

## Conflict Plan

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Open communication: Honest, clear, feeling comfortable taking risks to clear the air, no grudges
- Timeouts - Walk away when things get heated so they don’t escalate

- Team vote on major decisions

What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Respectfully draw their attention to the behavior and give them an opportunity to wrap up their thoughts.
- Hand off the conversation to another person.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Designating tasks based on comprehension, possibly paired programming as a learning opportunity
- Ask questions
- Preschool mindset - continuous learning
- Be cool

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
